# Covid-19-Spread-analysis---detection

This repository contains a Python script for simulating the spread of COVID-19 in a set of countries. The simulation is based on Markov chains and utilizes demographic data to model the movement of individuals between health states.

## Overview

The code in this repository is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Create a sample dataset of individuals in specified countries based on demographic data.
2. Simulate the progression of COVID-19 for the individuals in the sample dataset using a Markov chain model.
3. Generate summary data that shows the state of individuals in each country on each day of the simulation.
4. Create plots and graphs to visualize the simulation results.

## Installation

Before running the code, you need to have Python and the required dependencies installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy

## Usage

To run the COVID-19 simulation, you need to provide the following input parameters:

countries_csv_name: The name of the CSV file containing demographic data for countries.
countries: A list of countries to include in the simulation.
start_date and end_date: The date range for the simulation.
sample_ratio: The ratio for creating the sample dataset

##Sample Data

The code reads demographic data from a CSV file and creates a sample dataset of individuals in the specified countries. The sample size is determined by the sample_ratio.

## Simulation

The simulation is based on Markov chains, and it models the progression of individuals' health states over time. The simulation considers the demographic distribution of age groups and transitions between health states based on provided probabilities.

## Summary Data

The code generates summary data that shows the state of individuals in each country on each day of the simulation. The summary data is saved to a CSV file named a3-covid-summary-timeseries.csv.
